# PulleySwift

A modern Swift implementation of pulley finite element analysis (FEA) for conveyor belt systems.

## Overview

PulleySwift is a Swift-based rewrite of the C++ PulleyMavenWebService, providing structural analysis for conveyor pulleys using finite element methods. The project aims to bring modern Swift features, improved maintainability, and cross-platform capabilities to pulley engineering calculations.

## Architecture

The project is organized into modular Swift packages:

### PulleyCore
Core domain models and data structures:
- `Material` - Material properties (Young's modulus, yield strength, density, etc.)
- `Belt` - Belt configuration and loading parameters
- `Hub` - Hub geometry specifications
- `PulleyInput` - Complete input specification for FEA analysis
- `PulleyType` - Pulley configuration types (live shaft, dead shaft, stub, etc.)
- Supporting structures: `ShellInput`, `ShaftInput`, `EndDiskAssembly`, etc.

### PulleyFEA
Finite element analysis engine:
- `Element` - Base protocol for finite elements
- `Node` - FEA mesh nodes with displacement tracking
- Transfer matrix-based 1D element implementations
- Assembly and solution algorithms

### PulleyStandards
Engineering design standards:
- `Criterium` - Base protocol for design criteria
- ANSI standard implementation (planned)
- DIN 15018 standard implementation (planned)
- AS 1403 standard implementation (planned)

### PulleyBOM
Bill of materials and costing:
- `MaterialDatabase` - Material lookup and search
- Plate thickness and cost optimization
- Component costing calculations

## Requirements

- Swift 6.2+
- macOS 13+ or iOS 16+
- Xcode 15+ (for development)

## Building

```bash
swift build
```

## Testing

```bash
swift test
```

All tests currently pass (5 tests in PulleyCore module).

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation (In Progress)**

âœ… Completed:
- Project structure and Swift Package Manager setup
- Core domain models (Material, Belt, Hub, PulleyInput, etc.)
- Basic FEA infrastructure (Node, Element protocol)
- Engineering standards protocol (Criterium)
- BOM interface definitions
- Unit tests for core models
- JSON Codable support for all data structures

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- FEA element implementations (Shell, Disk, Shaft)
- Matrix operations layer
- Engineering standards calculations

ðŸ“‹ Planned:
- Transfer matrix computation
- Stiffness matrix assembly
- Linear system solver
- Complete engineering standards
- Web service layer
- Integration tests

## Migration from C++

This project is being converted from the C++ codebase at `PulleyMavenWebService`. Key conversion strategies:

1. **Data Models**: Direct Swift struct conversion with Codable support (replaces Boost.PropertyTree)
2. **FEA Engine**: Protocol-based design with potential C++ interop for Eigen-dependent calculations
3. **Numerical Computing**: Evaluating Apple Accelerate framework vs C++ interop with Eigen
4. **JSON I/O**: Native Swift Codable (cleaner than Boost.PropertyTree)

## Design Decisions

### Hybrid vs Pure Swift Approach

We're evaluating two approaches for the numerical computing core:

**Option A: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- Keep Eigen-dependent FEA code in C++
- Wrap via Swift 5.9+ C++ interoperability
- Expose Swift-friendly APIs
- Lower risk, faster initial development

**Option B: Pure Swift**
- Use Apple Accelerate framework (BLAS/LAPACK)
- Build custom sparse matrix layer
- Reimplement transfer matrix algorithms
- Higher risk, better long-term maintainability
